# College Homework - Tetris

This is a game I made back in 2011 as a homework for Algorithms I course while I was studying Computer Science at UNESP, a brazilian public university.

We were asked to code a game with our newly acquired knowledge, and I found it to be the perfect oportunity to try and create my favorite casual game. 

This code illustrates how matrices can be used to portray a gameboard, and how simple changes in state can create a fairly fluid game dynamic, no matter the language chosen.

I will soon add some explanation on how it works, english comments and what can be improved on my initial code.
